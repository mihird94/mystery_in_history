**A Computational appraoch to solve a age old problem for historians

*About the Federalist Papers

Quote from the Library of Congress http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/federalist.html
The Federalist Papers were a series of eighty-five essays urging the citizens of New York to ratify the new
United States Constitution. Written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, the essays
originally appeared anonymously in New York newspapers in 1787 and 1788 under the pen name “Publius.”
A bound edition of the essays was first published in 1788, but it was not until the 1818 edition published by
the printer Jacob Gideon that the authors of each essay were identified by name. The Federalist Papers are
considered one of the most important sources for interpreting and understanding the original intent of the
Constitution.

*About the disputed authorship

The original essays can be downloaded from the Library of Congress. http://thomas.loc.gov/home/histdox/
fedpapers.html
In the author column, you will find 74 essays with identified authors: 51 essays written by Hamilton, 15 by
Madison, 3 by Hamilton and Madison, 5 by Jay. The remaining 11 essays, however, is authored by “Hamilton
or Madison”. These are the famous essays with disputed authorship. Hamilton wrote to claim the authorship
before he was killed in a duel. Later Madison also claimed authorship. Historians were trying to find out
which one was the real author.

**In This project, I will try to find out who actually wrote the disputed essays. Please read the markdown for a detailed project report.

Approach Used:-
1. K-means Clustering
2. Decison Tree Analysis 

*Using Clustering Approaches:-

*Here is the cluster-plot for K-mean:-
